1. Firstly need to install the sslcommerz-lib packages.
2. If needed then create a separate app for payments.
3. There needs the models of Transaction, PaymentGatewaySettings or something like that.
4. Need to register those models into admin.py 
5. Create a python file named sslcommerz.py and create some function as like "sslcommerz_payment_gateway" 
    and fill up this function with proper configurations as like success_url, failed_url, tran_id, currency etc.

6. Configure those urls inside urls.py
7. And use this inside where the payment method needed.
